# Bundle Crash Fix

Protect yourself from nasty cheaters trying to crash the server with Bundles!

How it works:  
- Player crafts a bundle
- sends specifically crafted packets that would crash Minecraft
- Bundle Crash Fix: Prevents the handling of the packet -> the server doesn't even notice anything, no crash ðŸŽ‰
