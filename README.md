# Bundle Crash Fix

Protect yourself from nasty cheaters trying to crash the server with Bundles!

## How it works
- A player crafts a bundle
- Sends specifically crafted packets that would crash Minecraft
- **Bundle Crash Fix**: Prevents the handling of the packet â†’ the server doesn't even notice anything â€” no crash ðŸŽ‰

## Currently Supporting
