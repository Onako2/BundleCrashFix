# Bundle Crash Fix

Protect yourself from nasty cheaters trying to crash the server with Bundles!

How it works:  
- Player crafts a bundle
- sends specifically crafted packets that would crash Minecraft
- Bundle Crash Fix: Prevents the handling of the packet -> the server doesn't even notice anything, no crash 🎉  

Currently supporting:  
- Bukkit
- Spigot
- Paper
- Purpur
- Bungeecord
- Waterfall
- Velocity
- Fabric
- Quilt
- Forge
- NeoForge
